    <h1>VaultLock</h1>
    <p>Zero-knowledge offline password manager with local encryption, secure vault controls, and a modern desktop admin experience.</p>
</div>

## Problem Statement

Managing sensitive credentials across personal and professional accounts becomes risky when secrets are stored in cloud-tied systems or scattered notes. Users need strong encryption, local control, and fast retrieval without relying on external servers. VaultLock solves this by combining offline-first security, encrypted local storage, and an organized desktop workflow in one app.

## Features

### Authentication & Vault Security

- ● **Master Password Protection:** Vault access is protected by a master password, and plaintext secrets are never persisted directly.
- ● **Strong Key Derivation:** Argon2id-based derivation hardens password-to-key generation against brute-force attacks.
- ● **Encrypted Credential Storage:** Credential entries are encrypted before being written to the local database.
- ● **Clipboard Safety Controls:** Sensitive values copied to clipboard can be auto-cleared to reduce leakage risk.

### Credential Management

- ● **Organized Vault Structure:** Group credentials by folders and manage favorites for faster access.
- ● **Quick Search & Details View:** Find and inspect credentials efficiently through searchable lists and detail panels.
- ● **Credential Creation UX:** Dedicated add/edit flows improve consistency when storing account secrets.
- ● **Logo Enrichment:** Website/domain logos are fetched and cached to make entries easier to recognize visually.

### Desktop Experience & Operations

- ● **Fluent QML Interface:** Desktop UI is built with PyQt6 + QML for smooth, modern interactions.
- ● **Offline-First Operation:** Core functionality works locally without requiring external APIs or hosted services.
- ● **Portable Build Support:** Project can be packaged into an executable for easier distribution.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
    <img src="diagram/Architecture.png" alt="VaultLock Architecture" width="640" style="object-fit: contain;" />
</p>


1. User logs in with master password.
2. Vault key is derived locally using Argon2id parameters and salt.
3. App decrypts only required data in memory for active operations.
4. Create/update credential operations encrypt data before SQLite writes.
5. UI components render vault state, folders, and details in QML views.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend/UI:** PyQt6, QML (Qt Quick)  
**Backend/App Logic:** Python 3.10+  
**Database:** SQLite  
**Security & Crypto:** cryptography, argon2-cffi  
**Build/Packaging:** PyInstaller

## How It Works

1. On first use, user sets a master password.
2. VaultLock initializes secure local storage and cryptographic configuration.
3. Credentials are encrypted at write time and decrypted on-demand.
4. Folder navigation and search power quick vault discovery.
5. Copy actions and UI safeguards reduce accidental credential exposure.
